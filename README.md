Algorithms
==========

Contains various algorithms that I implemented for my course on 'Design and analysis of Algorithms' for my Master's degree. I had implemented the algorithms in C++. 

The algorithms include dynamic programming algorithms and Divide and Conquer algorithms. The problem desciption can be found in the corresponding README files.
